# Chapter Timer

A simple **1 minute 20 second countdown timer** for CompTIA chapter pages that automatically restarts whenever you navigate to a new chapter.

## How to set it up

1. **Copy the code** from this link:  
   [CompTIA Bookmark.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/killerqueen2007/CompTIA-Count-down-timer/refs/heads/main/CompTIA/Bookmark.js)

2. **Enable the bookmarks bar** in your browser (shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + B`).

3. **Add a new bookmark** and give it any name you like.  

   <img width="280" height="631" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd76a2ce-f0ce-481c-bb25-ffa0fb343ccd" />

4. In the URL field of the bookmark, **type:**  
   `javascript:`

5. **Paste the code** you copied in Step 1 immediately after `javascript:`.

6. Save the bookmark. Now, whenever you click it on a CompTIA chapter page, the timer will start and automatically reset when moving to the next chapter.
