# Chapter Timer

A small 1 minute 20 second countdown timer for CompTIA chapter pages that restarts automatically when navigating to a new chapter.

This repository provides two ways to use it:

- **Bookmarklet** – Quick and easy, works on-the-fly on any chapter page.

- **Chrome Extension** – Automatically loads on all chapter pages, including SPA navigation, and starts the timer after the page fully loads.
